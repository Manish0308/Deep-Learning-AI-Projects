xcellent follow-up — let’s compare SEQ_SIZE = 4 vs SEQ_SIZE = 6 in the context of your small dataset (49 timestamps total) to decide what’s best.

🔍 What SEQ_SIZE Means
SEQ_SIZE = N means: use N past time steps to predict the next (1 step ahead).

So with SEQ_SIZE = 4, your model learns patterns based on the last 4 time steps (20 minutes) to predict the next one (5 minutes later).

With SEQ_SIZE = 6, it looks back 30 minutes.

📊 Trade-Offs: SEQ_SIZE = 4 vs SEQ_SIZE = 6
Factor	SEQ_SIZE = 4	SEQ_SIZE = 6
Training Sequences	49 - 4 = 45	49 - 6 = 43
Temporal Context	20 minutes	30 minutes (better)
Model Learning Depth	Slightly less info	Slightly more temporal depth
Overfitting Risk	Lower (less data per input)	Slightly higher, but minor
Generalization	Possibly less context	Better for capturing patterns

✅ Recommendation
If you want very fast training, fewer parameters, and don’t need long-term dependency: go with SEQ_SIZE = 4.

If you want the model to learn slightly richer temporal dependencies and can afford 2 fewer samples: go with SEQ_SIZE = 6.







Why inputnumT = 12 * inputnum was used:
In the original ST-CGCN code (like for PEMS03), the authors aimed to capture both short-term and long-term temporal dependencies in traffic flow. Here's what the components mean:

inputnum: number of short-term sequence steps. For example, if your data is sampled every 5 minutes and inputnum = 8, that covers the past 40 minutes.

12 * inputnum: long-term span, where 12 refers to a fixed time gap (12 × 5 minutes = 1 hour). This means they’re taking samples from:

t - 12*8, t - 12*7, ..., t - 12*1

This skips ahead in time, grabbing data at the same time of day in previous periods, which is assumed to model daily or periodic traffic patterns.

Your Case:
You have:

49 timestamps

Each timestamp is 5 minutes apart (i.e., total duration: 49 × 5 = 245 minutes ≈ 4 hours)

That’s a very short time span compared to real-world datasets like PEMS03 (which might span weeks/months).

Can we reduce 12?
Yes, absolutely. You should reduce the inputnumT multiplier to avoid indexing outside the available 49 samples.

Recommendation:
Set inputnumT = 4 * inputnum or even 2 * inputnum.

For example, if:

inputnum = 8

then inputnumT = 4 * 8 = 32

Then the long-term sequence looks back from:

t - 32, t - 28, ..., t - 4

That gives you 8 samples with moderate temporal gaps.

Summary:
12 was used to simulate long-range periodic traffic behavior in larger datasets.

In your small dataset with only 49 steps, using 12 is too much — it would restrict training windows too much or cause out-of-bound errors.

✅ Safe value: inputnumT = 4 * inputnum or adjust based on validation.
